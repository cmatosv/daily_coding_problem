    "### Problem 0 [Example]:\n",
    "There's a staircase with $N$ steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given $N$, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $N = 4$, then there are 5 unique ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1, 1, 1, 1\n",
    "- 2, 1, 1\n",
    "- 1, 2, 1\n",
    "- 1, 1, 2\n",
    "- 2, 2\n",
    "\n",
    "What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers $X$? For example, if $X = {1, 3, 5}$, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time. Generalize your function to take in $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "It's always good to start off with some test cases. Let's start with small cases and see if we can find some sort of pattern.\n",

    "What's the relationship?\n",
    "\n",
    "The only ways to get to $N = 3$, is to first get to $N = 1$, and then go up by 2 steps, or get to $N = 2$ and go up by 1 step. So $f(3) = f(2) + f(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this hold for $N = 4$? Yes, it does. Since we can only get to the 4th step by getting to the 3rd step and going up by one, or by getting to the 2nd step and going up by two. So $f(4) = f(3) + f(2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize, $f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)$. That's just the Fibonacci sequence!"
